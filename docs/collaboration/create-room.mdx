# Create Room

Currently, Pinfig provides peer-to-peer live collaboration, similar to live meeting rooms. Within a meeting room, you can collaborate with other people on bords and notes together.

You can create a room using the blue "Live" button. Every room has a unique link and a folder. The roomsâ€™ folders are within the Pinfig **shared** folder in your vault.
