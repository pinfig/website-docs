# Block

A block is a distinct type of content within the Pinfig text editor. This includes elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. For instance, when you write some text and hit the "Enter" key, Pinfig creates a paragraph block.

You can drag and drop blocks to reorder them within the editor.
