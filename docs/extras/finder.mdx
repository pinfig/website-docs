# Finder

Finder is the search tool within Pinfig, and it comes in two forms.

The Vault Finder, accessible through the top Navbar, searches your vault for everything matching with your keywords.

The Board Finder resides within the Dock tools, nestled within a board. It conducts a similar search across your vault, finding matches to your keywords. What sets it apart is that it highlights search results within the board to easy identify notes.
