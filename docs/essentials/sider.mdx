# Sider

The Sider is a contextual view that enhances your note-taking experience by offering additional features to aid in viewing, filtering, analyzing, and comprehending your notes in context.

The Sider view presents three primary perspectives:

- **Inbox**: A list- and tab-based view allowing you to explore multiple notes.

- **Explorer**: Enables exploration of interlinks between notes, such as outgoing and incoming links, unlinked notes, and similar notes.

- **Starred**: A place to access your starred notes and boards.
