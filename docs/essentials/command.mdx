# Command

A command is like a secret key, unlocking swift access to Pinfig's features.

Just type "/" (without the double quotes) within a note editor to see Pinfig commands in action.

As you begin typing the term for a command after "/", Pinfig will offer suggestions, closely aligned with the term you're typing.
