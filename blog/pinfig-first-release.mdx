We are very happy to introduce Pinfig to help make visual sense making easier for everyday work.

We created Pinfig for the following reasons:

- To support the sense making loop, for learning, writing, brainstorming, and collaboration.
- To leverage visual tools that help create, view, filter, analyze, and make sense of information.
- To make it easier to collect, develop and express information and knowledege in unique ways.
- To help disseminate educational content visually and effectively, free of charge.

Pinfig first release! Beta-1 is out ðŸŽ‰. [Download](/download) ðŸ¥³
