We are very happy to ship the first release candidate for the new version of Pinfig.

In the past few months, we have worked on two main areas.
The first area was improving the stability and usability of Pinfig.
The second area was shipping a number of AI tools to support in-situ AI assistance, including:

- Board AI assistant: diagram/graph generation (grid, concept map, radial map)
- Board AI assistant: image generation
- Board AI assistant: Chat interface
- AI assistant in text editor
- AI assistant in pdf reader
- AI assistant in board context menu

We also ship a number of tools that improve the usability, including:

- Board undo/redo; please use keys: Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z
- Board semantic zooming
- Board background colors
- Board grid patterns (canvas templates)
- Explorer new tree layout
- Board new minimap

Further, we ship **community boards**, where you can share and discover community-made boards, and more.
