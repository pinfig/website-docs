# Vault

A vault is the designated folder in your file system where you securely store your notes using Pinfig.

Pinfig organizes this vault with four key sub-folders:

- **boards**: houses your boards

- **notes**: contains your individual notes

- **shared**: stores collaborative notes

- **attachments**: keeps files like images and PDFs

Plus, there's a **.trash** folder where trashed notes are placed.
