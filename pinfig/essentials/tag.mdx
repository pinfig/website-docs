# Tag

Similar to a link, a tag is a term you can attach to a note, offering a way to associate it with relevant concepts. A note can carry several tags, serving as convenient entry points to related notes.

Within Pinfig, tags are created by typing "#" or by using the "/" command.

Furthermore, you can easily search notes by their tags using the format “#term”.
