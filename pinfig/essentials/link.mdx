# Link

A link signifies a relationship between two notes.

There are two types of links in Pinfig. First, the Hyperlink, connecting two notes within the vault. It's created by typing "@" or using the "/ "command.

The second type of link is created by joining two notes with a visual line. To do so, hover over a note card on a board, then (i) drag the small dot at the card's bottom and (ii) drop it on another note card.

Double-clicking a link allows you to add a label.
